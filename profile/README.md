Welcome to the GitHub organization of the [**Software Reliability Lab (SR-Lab)**](https://sr-lab.github.io/), a research group focused on methods and techniques for improving the quality and dependability of software systems, emphasising the construction of practical tools that can have societal impact. Our work spans from empirical software engineering methods that can inform practitioners and direct future research, to formal methods that can verify the absence of certain types of bugs.

## 💡 What We Do

We work at the intersection of:

- 📐 **Programming Languages and Formal Methods**  
- 🛠 **Software Verification and Static Analysis**  
- 🧪 **Empirical Software Engineering**  

Our research produces both insights and tools—often open-source—that help developers understand and improve the systems they build.
We work in domains such as:

- ☁️ **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
- 📱 **Android Applications**  
- 🔐 **Ethereum Smart Contracts**
